# worldClocks

Background:

The clock is displayed on a canvas and the map on another canvas using Javacsript and HTML. It was a simple calculation using seconds and certain functions such as getTimezoneOffset() and setInterval() to make the clock active. I recognize that there are many well-known cities in each time zone, but for some zones, I chose the one that are not as well known as European and North American cities. By default, London is displayed as its time zone is the central one in the world (UTC). I had a lot of fun playing around with the font of the digital clock, as well as picking the background photos for each time zone. Please note that currently, these time zones for certain cities are in default mode (and not in their summer time zones).
